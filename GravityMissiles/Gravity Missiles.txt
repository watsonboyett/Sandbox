Gravity Missiles:

[Game-play]
P1 shoots a (slow moving) missile at P2's base.
P2 responds by shooting a missile either at P1's first missile or at P1's base.
P1 responds by shooting a missile at P2's missile (or P1's base)
(this is pretty much Tank Wars, but with static launch sites)

[Controls]
Trajectory is controlled by drawing a vector from the launchpad into 'space'
Velocity is controlled by the magnitude of the drawn vector
While drawing the vector, trajectory paths are computed for opponent's (and friendly?) missiles
Intercept locations are also computed for given launch velocity (e.g. point here for the given velocity to hit oppenent's missile)

[Mechanics]
Missiles have gravitational effects (i.e. they affect the trajectories of all other missiles, even if they don't intercept)
	Heavier missiles have more gravitational effects (just like gravity!)
Limited amount of fuel (higher velocities require more fuel reserves)
Limited number of missiles at one time (can't just bombard each other)
